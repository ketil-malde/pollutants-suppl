Statistical analyses of the different contaminants in North East
Atlantic cod and haddock liver samples.  All analyses were performed
using the \texttt{python} programming language.  Figures were created
using \texttt{matplotlib}, and regression was performed using the
\texttt{OLS} method from the \texttt{statsmodels} package.  The
\texttt{pandas} library was used for data import and manipulation.

Contamination level $C$ in each case as was modeled as a function of
fish weight $w$ and year $y$.

\begin{equation*}
ln(C) \sim \alpha ln(w) + \beta y + k
\end{equation*}
